                <h3>Gamemode</h3>
                <p> 
                    On Terraria's title screen you can pick the game mode you would like to play. The available options are Single Player or Multiplayer on the Desktop version Desktop, Console version Console, and Mobile version Mobile versions, or Play Game on the Old-gen console version Old-gen console and 3DS version versions. 
                    The Switch, Old-gen console version Old-gen console and 3DS versionversions have a built-in Tutorial that we recommend completing first. 
                    This guide will assume you have chosen Single Player, as it is easier to learn to play the game, so choose that option for now. 
                </p>
                <h3>Character Creation</h3>
                <p>
                    After selecting the game mode<code></code>, you'll have to create and select your own character. 
                    Click the New button on the bottom right to open the character creation screen. Here, you can change a number of your character's properties. 
                </p>
                <strong>Name and Difficulty</strong>
                <p>
                    Your character's name will display<code></code> when logging into a world, sending messages in chat, and whenever you die. It does not have to be the same as your Steam or console username.
                    You can choose different character difficulty options: Classic (also known as Softcore), Mediumcore, Hardcore, and JourneyDesktop version.
                    The character difficulty setting determines what happens when the character dies - it does not affect any other aspects of gameplay, including how hard the enemies will be. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classic, or Softcore, means that the player will drop some of their Coins upon death. Depending on world difficulty, you may drop half, 3/4, or all of your coins. Lost coins can be picked up by returning to your death location, but you may have to defeat an enemy to get them back.</li>
                        <li>Mediumcore means that the player will drop every item they are carrying upon death. Dropped items may be permanently lost if the player falls into lava, is killed by an explosive, or exits the world.</li>
                        <li>Hardcore means that the player has only 1 life; if they die, the character file is permanently deleted.</li>
                        <li>Journey Mode gives the player various cheat options, like a limited Creative mode. Journey characters can access the cheat menu by pressing <code>C</code>, allowing them to enable godmode, duplicate items, set the time and weather, disable enemy spawning, etc. However, Journey characters can only enter in Journey Mode worlds.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>Appearance</strong>
                <p>
                    Characters can be visually customized by changing their gender appearance, hairstyle, eye color, skin color, and clothing. 
                    All but eye and skin colors can be changed in-game using certain items.

                <h3>Crafting Basics</h3>
                <p> The crafting aspect is slightly different across different versions of Terraria. To access the crafting menu, press the <kbd>Inventory key</kbd> while in-game. 
                    This will bring up the heads-up display, showing your inventory, equipment slots, and other options. The crafting menu is located in the bottom left of your screen, as indicated in the image below. 
                    On Console version Console, press <code>Triangle</code> (Playstation) / <code>Y</code> (Xbox One Xbox 360) / <code>X</code> (Nintendo Switch). 
                    From there, switch tabs on Old-gen console version Old-gen console to access the crafting interface and on Console version Console, switch menus (L1 / R1) LB RB. 
                </p>
                <P>
                    The items that can be currently crafted will appear in this menu. Your crafting options are determined by the items you have in your inventory, as well as your proximity to various crafting stations. Next to a selected item's icon in the list, its crafting recipe appears.
                    To navigate this menu, you can click or use the mouse wheel to scroll through items. You can also see all craftable items at once by clicking the hammer icon below the word "Crafting". To select an item (as depicted by a yellow border), simply click on it, and to craft it, click it again. 
                    The newly crafted item will attach itself to your cursor, and from there it can be placed in your inventory or dropped by right-clicking outside of your inventory space. Large numbers of stackable items can be crafted by right-clicking and holding the icon, which quickly creates and stacks that item until the stack is full, you run out of materials, or simply let go. To exit your inventory, press the Inventory key again.
                    Upon crafting, there is a 75% chance that a weapon or accessory is provided with a random modifier, slightly altering its quality. There is no way to predict what modifier will be applied on an item, and many items cannot get modifiers at all. 
                </P>
                <h3>Crafting Stations</h3>
                <p>
                    Many recipes require that you have a crafting station to craft them. The first crafting station available is the Work Bench, which can be crafted without any crafting station. 
                    To use a crafting station, it must be placed in the world, and you must be standing close enough to it (see image). Items you can craft using the station will then be added to the list of items you can currently craft. It is possible to stand near many crafting stations simultaneously to craft items using any of these stations. 
                    Additionally, some items, such as the Copper Watch or Waterfall Blocks require that you stand next to multiple different crafting stations to be able to craft them. 
                </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="Houses">
                <header>Houses</header>
                <h3>House</h3>
                <p>
                    House<code></code> (or Home) is a structure built by the player that Town NPCs require in order to spawn, with one House required per NPC. A structure must meet several requirements in order to function as a House (see details below). You can check if a structure meets the requirements by using the Housing Menu's top button, labeled with a question mark ("?"). NPCs generally retreat to their Houses at night and remain in them until dawn. They will also retreat to their houses during a Solar Eclipse or Rain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Guide will appear upon starting a new world, and if killed, he will require a House in order to respawn. The Old Man, the Traveling Merchant, and the Skeleton Merchant do not require Houses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, the Guide, Angler, Goblin Tinkerer, TavernkeepDesktop and Console versions, Mechanic, Stylist, Wizard, Tax CollectorDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions, and Golfer Desktop version will each make their initial appearances regardless of available housing. Once initially found, each will require a suitable House before respawning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Certain naturally-generated structures can serve as Houses and may inadvertently attract NPCs if players have placed light sources within them. These can include Floating Island structures, and Console Version Old-gen console version Mobile version 3DS version before 1.4, Living Tree treasure rooms qualified. NPCs can be moved from these to the player's structures using the Housing Menu.
                    The requirements for a player-selected Bed to work as a spawn point are similar to those for NPC housing, but weaker. Players do not need furniture beyond the bed. See the Beds page for full details.
                </p>
                <h3>Housing Menu</h3>
                <p>
                    The menu for managing the placement of NPCs, accessed through clicking the small house icon above the armor slots.
                    The Housing menu allows you to check whether the houses you have built are suitable for use or not, as well as to manually appoint a house for a specific NPC. To access this menu, click on the house icon in your inventory. 
                </p>
                <h3>Framework</h3>
                <p>
                    A house must be fully enclosed with the following features: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The side walls (vertical blocks) can be made of blocks, Doors, Platforms or Tall Gates.</li>
                        <li>The floor and ceiling (horizontal blocks) are made of blocks, Trap Doors or Platforms. The whole floor cannot be made of platforms.</li>
                        <li>Including the above frame (floor, side walls, and ceiling), a house must have at least 60 total tiles, but fewer than 750.</li>
                        <li>The house must include a light source, a "flat surface" item, and a "comfort item". The smallest and simplest items which qualify are respectively a torch, a workbench, and a chair.</li>
                        <li>The NPC needs at least one solid (non-platform) block to stand on at night, and a 2x3 area unobstructed by foreground blocks.</li>
                        <li>A house must have at least one "entrance", which can be a Door or Tall Gate in a side wall, a Trap Door in the ceiling or floor, or a Platform in the ceiling, floor, or side walls. This entrance does not need to be usable by the NPC (for example, NPCs can't use trap doors) nor does it have to lead "outdoors".</li>
                    </ul>

                <header>Plants</header>
                <p> Plants are found all across a Terraria world, and may grow from certain block types given various conditions. 
                    Most can be harvested for use, and may additionally drop seeds for replanting, such as Jungle grass and seeds. Different biomes generally have distinct plant life.
                </p>
                <h3>Grass</h3>
                <p>
                    Grass enables many plants to grow on it, and covers most of the aboveground landscape. There are six types of grass: Normal, Corrupt, Crimson, Mushroom, Jungle and Hallowed.

                <h3>Moss</h3>
                <p>
                    Moss is a grass-like plant that grows on Stone Blocks. It comes in five Old-gen console version 3DS version / six Console Version Mobile version / nine Desktop version colors, and one color can be found throughout each third of a given map (three colors per world), either randomly on cave surfaces or in "moss chambers" with a matching mossy stone wall. 
                    Moss sprouts fuzz that can be cut like grass weeds, or can be collected using a Paint Scraper on Desktop version Desktop version 1.4.0.1. Only a small percentage of such moss will drop as an item when using a paint scraper, the rest will simply disappear as usual. 
                    Collected moss can be placed on stone or Gray Bricks, or used to craft mossy stone walls. Mossy stone requires one more hit to break than clean stone. Moss will be destroyed if the stone block it is on converts to ebonstone, crimstone, or pearlstone.
                    Desktop, Console, and Mobile versions Lava Moss is a special variant of moss that can only be found in the lava layers of the Cavern, though if harvested, it can be planted at any level. 
                    Despite not being considered one of the Glowing Mosses, it glows in the dark.Desktop version Glowing Mosses are special variants of moss that grow in Glowing Moss Caves in much larger areas than standard moss, and glow in the dark similarly to lava moss. 
                    It comes in three versions: Krypton, Xenon, and Argon. Only one type of Glowing Moss can be found in each world, in a total of up to 2 (Small) / 3 (Medium) / 4 (Large) areas in the Cavern layer, mostly above the lava layers, but not under the Spawn area.  
                </p>
                <h3>Herbs</h3>
                <p>
                    Herbs are used at a Placed Bottle or an Alchemy Table to craft potions. 
                    They can be found all across the world, or in Herb BagsDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions, and can be harvested with almost any weapon or tool. 
                    Each herb will bloom when certain requirements are met. Herbs harvested while blooming will drop 1-3 seeds of their kind in addition. 
                    There are currently 7 different types of herbs. In addition to their natural soil, herbs can also be grown in Clay Pots, or Desktop, Console, and Mobile versions within Planter Boxes. 
                    The Daybloom can also be dropped from Angry Dandelions.

                    Enemies are characters which attempt to inflict damage on players. This page lists all enemies that can be encountered in Terraria.
                    Enemies do not take fall damage. See NPC spawning and NPC despawning for details on how the game determines where and when enemies spawn.
                    There are a total of 372 enemies: 139 pre-Hardmode, 231 Hardmode, and 2 unspawnable. Out of these, 121 belong to events (26 pre-Hardmode and 95 Hardmode), 20 are bosses (9 pre-Hardmode and 11 Hardmode), 14 are event bosses (1 pre-Hardmode and 13 Hardmode), 19 are bosses' servants (7 pre-Hardmode and 12 Hardmode), and 14 are enemy variants exclusive to the Old-gen console version Old-gen console version and 3DS version version (7 pre-Hardmode and 7 Hardmode).

                <h3>Pre-Hardmode Bosses</h3>
                <p>
                    These are the first bosses the player can encounter. Usually, defeating one of these bosses will give the player items and materials necessary to progress in the game, eventually leading to Hardmode.
                </p>
                <strong>King Slime</strong>
                <p>
                King Slime is a giant blue slime with 2,000 / 2,800 / 3,570 health. It is summoned with a Slime Crown, after killing 150 (75 if he has already been killed) slimes during a Slime RainDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions, or can also rarely appear in the outer thirds of the map completely by itself. 
                As with all enemies that can spawn naturally, the King Slime has a better chance of spawning while standing near a placed Water Candle or while under the effects of a Battle Potion.
                On the Desktop version Desktop, Console version Console, and Mobile version Mobile versions, King Slime can teleport to the player if he gets trapped or if the player gets out of his reach for too long.
                King Slime does not provide access to game-advancing items upon defeat, but outside Expert Mode will drop one Gold Coin, one or two piece(s) of Ninja clothes, and one of several slime-related items.
                In Expert Mode (and Master Mode), King Slime can summon Spiked Slimes, that are similar to the Spiked Jungle Slime and Spiked Ice Slime.
                </p>
                <strong>Eye of Cthulhu</strong>
                <p>
                The Eye of Cthulhu is a huge eyeball with 2,800 / 3,640 / 4,641 health. It has a 1 in 3 chance of spawning at the beginning of each night once the player has 200 HP or more, 3 or more NPCs living in houses, and over 10 defense. It will continue to do so until defeated for the first time. 
                It can also be summoned using a Suspicious Looking Eye at night. If not defeated by the player by the end of the night, it will travel upwards and despawn. This is generally the first boss a player must face. It travels through blocks, and spawns Servants of Cthulhu.
                In Expert Mode (and Master Mode), the Eye of Cthulhu will do a fast chain dash in its second phase, using the attack more often the lower health it has. The chain dash attack will also scale in aggressiveness the same way. This can lead to it dashing almost continually at high velocity at very low health.
                </p>
                <strong>Eater of Worlds</strong>
                <p>
                The Eater of Worlds is a colossal worm with 10,050 / 15,120 / 19,224 health in total on the desktop version, and 7,500 on all other versions (10,500 on expert mode). It awakens after every third Shadow Orb is broken or after Worm Food is used. Shadow Orbs are found in the Corruption chasms, surrounded by Ebonstone, which requires a pickaxe with 65% pickaxe power or higher to mine, although explosives or Purification Powder can be used to bypass this. Once within range, Shadow Orbs can be destroyed with a hammer or explosives. The Eater of Worlds can only be summoned in worlds containing Corruption, and can be summoned at any time of the day. If it manages to escape the Corruption, it will flee and disappear.
                it is a large worm-type enemy that travels through tiles, and is made up of multiple sections that can each attack separately (with separate heads, no less) when they are cut off. To defeat this boss, every section must be brought down to less than two body parts to be killed (the smallest possible section is a head and a tail with no body pieces). Due to how helpful Corruption gear is, this will probably be the second boss faced in worlds that have Corruption, rather than those who have Crimson.
                The Eater of Worlds is the only source of Shadow Scales in the game, and it drops large amounts of Demonite Ore. They can be combined to make Shadow armor, but it can also be sold for almost 10 per stack of 99, making this technically the best pre-Hardmode boss for farming in the game.
                In Expert Mode, the boss is able to shoot dark-green projectiles at the player called Vile Spit, similar to those fired from Corruptors, another Corruption-exclusive enemy.
                </p>
                <strong>Brain of Cthulhu</strong>
                <p>
                The Brain of Cthulhu is a large, flying brain with a mere 1,000 / 1,700 / 2,167 health, giving it the lowest amount of health out of any boss. It spawns once for every third Crimson Heart that is broken or immediately after a Bloody Spine is used. Crimson Hearts are found in the Crimson's chasms, surrounded by Crimstone, which can be bypassed with the same methods Ebonstone can. However, some of the pockets containing these will generate open. Once within range, Crimson Hearts can be destroyed with a Hammer or any tile-breaking explosive. It can only be summoned in the Crimson, but at any time of day.
                The Brain of Cthulhu has two forms. In the first form, the brain cannot be harmed, and Creepers will float around it. After all of these are killed, the Brain of Cthulhu will go into its second form, where it will teleport more frantically and move a lot faster, so a ranged weapon may be needed. The Brain of Cthulhu's second attack form is ramming, like the second form of Eye of Cthulhu. Unlike most other bosses, the Brain of Cthulhu is not immune to knockback.
                The Brain of Cthulhu is the only source of Tissue Samples in the game (other than the creepers spawned while fighting it), and drops a large amount of Crimtane Ore, which are their equivalents to the corruption items Shadow Scale and Demonite Ore respectively.
                In Expert Mode, the Brain of Cthulhu will have more health, and in its second phase, it will start creating illusions of itself to charge at the player. The lower the Brain of Cthulhu's HP gets, the illusions become much less obvious to the point where they will look exactly like the real Brain of Cthulhu. However, the minimap icon will still show the real Brain of Cthulhu, allowing players to bypass this.
                </p>
                <strong>Queen Bee</strong>
                <p>
                    Queen Bee is an enormous bee with 3,400 / 4,760 / 6,069 health. She is summoned by destroying her larva, encased within the walls of Bee Hives located in the Underground Jungle. She can also be summoned by the use of an Abeemination anywhere in the Jungle biome. She is the only source of Bee Wax in the game. Queen Bee is immune to knockback.
                    Queen Bee alternates between charging at the player, hovering above them whilst spawning Bees, and moving left and right whilst shooting stingers. In Expert Mode, the rate at which she charges the player gets faster the more damage she takes.
                    Defeating Queen Bee will allow the Witch Doctor to spawn; other than this, she does not advance the game in a major sense, though she does provide some decent loot that can further help the player prepare for the boss battle against the Wall of Flesh. One such weapon is the Beenade, which is extremely effective when fighting the Wall of Flesh.
                </p>
                <strong>Skeletron</strong>
                <p>
                Skeletron is a large skeletal head with 4,400 / 8,800 / 11,220 health and two hands. It is summoned by speaking to the Old Man NPC at the entrance of the Dungeon and activating his curse at night. Skeletron will alternate between attacking the player with its hands and performing a spinning attack. Its hands can be attacked and defeated to make the battle easier, although this is not required. If it has not been defeated before the night is over, Skeletron will attack and usually kill the player in one hit. It will then despawn.
                Defeating Skeletron will stop the Dungeon Guardians from spawning, allowing free access to the Dungeon. It can be summoned again by killing the Clothier with the Clothier Voodoo Doll equipped at night.
                In Expert Mode, Skeletron's head is more resistant to damage until its hands are destroyed. Once they are destroyed, it will start shooting homing skulls at the player. Expert mode Skeletron is much faster. Its hands inflict the Slow debuff, and its head inflicts Bleeding. If the player gets caught by its head-spin attack, Skeletron can "stun-lock" them, a lethal situation that can only be escaped by high mobility, e.g. with a hook.
                </p>
                <strong>Wall of Flesh</strong>
                <p>      
                    The Wall of Flesh is a towering wall that spans the entire screen height. It has 8,000 / 11,200 / 14,280 health. It is summoned by throwing a Guide Voodoo Doll into a pool of lava while the Guide is alive. It is the final boss of pre-Hardmode, because defeating it will irreversibly enable Hardmode in the world. It can drop several powerful items, one of them being the guaranteed drop Pwnhammer which can be used to break Demon Altars or Crimson Altars in order to spawn various game-advancing Hardmode ores.
                    Upon summoning the Wall of Flesh, the player will be afflicted with the Horrified debuff, which prevents fleeing from the battle – any attempt to do so will result in severe damage via The Tongue or instant death if the player tries to teleport away, and the debuff will not be removed until either the player or the Wall of Flesh is killed. The Wall of Flesh will then sweep across the map, moving faster as its HP gets lower. It must be killed before it reaches the end of the map, otherwise it will despawn and any living players in the Underworld will instantly die. Additionally, the Wall of Flesh's eyes fire lasers, with the rate of fire increasing as it takes damage. Its mouth burps Leeches that will chase the player, and it has small mouths attached to it called The Hungry, which will also move toward and damage the player.
                    In Expert Mode, the Wall of Flesh will greatly increase its movement speed as its health decreases, eventually surpassing even players riding the Bunny Mount or horse mountsDesktop version in movement speed. The Hungry will rapidly respawn, thus seemingly blocking the wall from attacks, and can deal significant damage themselves. The faster the Wall of Flesh moves and the quicker The Hungry respawn, the more the player will have to focus on dealing damage and moving across a decent terrain.

                <h3>Hardmode Bosses</h3>
                <strong>Queen Slime</strong>
                <p>
                    Queen Slime is a giant slime with 18,000 / 28,800 / 36,720 health. It is available to battle at the start of Hardmode, and is summoned from Gelatin Crystals in the Underground Hallow. It is an optional boss fight and is a small gap to challenge before facing the mechanical bosses, warranting equipment upgrades and other items. There is a very strong resemblance to the pre-Hardmode King Slime, and is one of two Hallowed bosses featured in the game. While its first form is straightforward with attack patterns similar to that of King Slime's, the second phase poses much more of a threat as the boss begins to fly in the air, shooting Crystal Slimes and projectiles from above. 
                </p>
                <strong>The Twins</strong>
                <p>
                    The Twins are a pair of cybernetic Eye of Cthulhus. They exist as two individual entities, known as Retinazer and Spazmatism, with the former having 20,000 / 30,000 / 38,250 health and the latter having 23,000 / 34,500 / 43,987 health. The Twins are summoned using a Mechanical Eye at night. It is worth noting that they will gain defense in their second forms, unlike the Eye of Cthulhu.
                    The two eyes have different fighting styles. Retinazer focuses on shooting the player with Death Lasers like the Destroyer's Probes. Once it reaches 40% HP, it will transform into its second form, replacing its pupil with a laser cannon. During this form, it will shoot lasers extremely fast, sometimes having the same fire rate as a Megashark.
                    The other eye, Spazmatism, focuses on slamming into the player and firing cursed flames. Once it reaches 40% HP, it will transform into its second form, resembling a mechanical version of the Eye of Cthulhu's second form. It will deal a lot more damage, and the flames it shoots are more consistent like the Flamethrower instead of the Cursed Flames, but the flames will still inflict Cursed Inferno debuff on the player. The last Twin destroyed will drop all of the loot.
                    In Expert Mode Spazmatism's charging attack will be similar to the Eye of Cthulhu's chain dash ability in its second form, and Retinazer will shoot lasers almost as rapid as the Wall of Flesh at extremely low health.
                </p>
                <strong>The Destroyer</strong>
                <p>
                    The Destroyer is a colossal mechanized Eater of Worlds with 80,000 / 120,000 / 153,000 health. It is considered the easiest Hardmode boss by many players, despite having the second-highest health. Although it is similar to its pre-Hardmode counterpart, the Eater of Worlds, it has some key differences: it will not divide into smaller segments, will shoot lasers from its body if space is available, and will deploy Probes to attack once a segment is destroyed.
                    The Destroyer is summoned by crafting and using a Mechanical Worm anywhere, but can only be spawned at night. The Destroyer will shoot Death Lasers, increasing in attack speed as it loses health. Weapons that deal damage to multiple segments like Flails, Daedalus Stormbow, and the Demon Scythe are recommended, because they will hit multiple sections of The Destroyer at once.
                    In Expert Mode, The Destroyer shoots rapidly at the player when they have less than half of their maximum health. The head of The Destroyer can also deal damage as high as 280 / 420, crippling the player if they are hit head-on.
                </p>
                <strong>Skeletron Prime</strong>
                <p>
                    Skeletron Prime is a weaponized mechanical variation of Skeletron, with the head alone having 28,000 / 42,000 / 53,550 health. Instead of two hands, it has four limbs – a vice, laser gun, saw, and cannon. With the head and all limbs combined, Skeletron Prime has 59,000 / 88,500 / 112,836 HP. However, like Skeletron, only the head has to be defeated. Skeletron Prime can be summoned as many times per world as needed, by crafting and using a Mechanical Skull, but it can only be summoned at night. It is more mobile than its predecessor, and it regularly flies off-screen, making targeting more difficult. It is also worth noting that when its head spins, its defense increases, unlike Skeletron, whose defense is dropped to 0 when spinning.
                    Skeletron Prime will drop Hallowed Bars and Souls of Fright upon being defeated, which are both used to craft many kinds of armor and tools. Like Skeletron, if Prime is not killed before the night ends, it will spin and target the player, generally killing the player in one hit, and will despawn afterwards.
                    In Expert Mode, Skeletron Prime follows around the same guidelines as Skeletron; it is less resistant to damage after its hands are destroyed, but its skull gains twice the amount of defense compared to normal mode Skeletron Prime when in its spinning attack. 
                </p>
                <strong>Plantera</strong>
                <p>
                    Plantera is an enormous flower with 30,000 / 42,000 / 53,549 health. She is awoken by destroying a Plantera's Bulb, which is found in the Underground Jungle after defeating all three mechanical bosses. If the player exits the Underground Jungle, Plantera becomes "enraged", gaining a significant boost to her stats.
                    Plantera has two phases. In her first phase, she clings to solid blocks using vine-like hooks and fires Seeds (and eventually Poison Seeds), which are much like Spiky Balls. In her second form, Plantera has increased speed and charges at the player. She will also release tendrils from her main body. In Expert ModeDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions, the seeds can go through walls and the tendrils are attached to each hook instead (3 on each), adding approximately 9 tendrils.
                    Once Plantera is defeated, the Dungeon will automatically spawn stronger Hardmode enemies, such as the Paladin, and more varieties of loot can be dropped.
                </p>
                <strong>Golem</strong>
                <p>
                    Golem is a large boss with a combined total of 39,000 / 58,500 / 74,586 health. It is summoned by using a Lihzahrd Power Cell at the Lihzahrd Altar in the Jungle Temple. In order to access the Jungle Temple, Plantera must be defeated to obtain the Temple Key.
                    Golem has two phases. During the first phase, its two fists and its head can be attacked. Like Skeletron, destroying the fists is not needed, but can be helpful. Once the head's health is depleted, it begins flying above the body while shooting fireballs and eye beams, leaving the body open to attack. The body will jump around and punch madly in this phase. Defeating the body will defeat Golem.
                </p>
                <strong>Empress of Light</strong>
                <p>
                    The Empress of Light is a Hallow-themed boss with 70,000 / 98,000 / 124,950 health. She can be summoned from killing a Prismatic Lacewing, and is one of two Hallowed bosses present in the game. This boss is meant to be a small gap in between Plantera and Golem, but can be fought later or skipped altogether, as it is an optional fight. However, if the player fights her the moment she is available, they will face a major difficulty spike and numerous attack patterns. This boss can also be fought in the day, which will make her "enraged", greatly increasing her attack damage to an instant-kill, but will drop the Terraprisma once beaten during the day.

                <strong>Duke Fishron</strong>
                <p>
                    Duke Fishron is a mutant shark-pig-dragon hybrid with 50,000 / 60,000 / 76,500 health. He is summoned when a Truffle Worm is used as bait for fishing in the Ocean.
                    In his first stage, Duke Fishron will attempt to ram the player five times before either firing explosive bubbles or summoning Sharknados. In his second stage, Duke Fishron gains glowing eyes and a boost to attack and defense. Although his ramming attacks remain the same, instead of shooting bubbles directly at the player, he flies quickly around in circles, sending bubbles everywhere. Instead of summoning Sharknados in this stage, Duke Fishron summons larger Cthulhunados. These remain in place until Duke Fishron is defeated.
                    In Expert Mode, when Duke Fishron gets to low enough health, he enters his third phase. In this phase, the screen turns dark, Duke Fishron becomes invisible, and only his glowing eyes are visible. He teleports and tries to ram the player with high speed few times, before he teleports again.
                </p>
                <strong>Lunatic Cultist</strong>
                <p>
                    The Lunatic Cultist is a comparably small boss with 32,000 / 40,000 / 76,500 health. It is summoned by killing the four cultists, which reside at the entrance of the Dungeon after Golem is defeated. When the Lunatic Cultist is defeated, the Lunar Events will begin.
                    The Lunatic Cultist's attacks become more powerful as it loses health. The Lunatic Cultist flies around randomly, cycling between shooting fireballs, creating a ball which shoots lightning at the player, shooting a giant snowflake which shoots ice shards around it, shooting shadowflames, and shooting five destructible projectiles twice in a row. The Lunatic Cultist will also create fake copies of itself, which will summon a Phantasm Dragon when damaged. If a Phantasm Dragon is still alive and the player damages these copies, it will summon an Ancient Vision instead. Waiting too long to attack the real Lunatic Cultist will also cause the Phantasm Dragon or Ancient Vision to be summoned.
                    In Expert Mode, the Lunatic Cultist will spawn Ancient Dooms along with its other attacks.

                <strong>Moon Lord</strong>
                <p>
                    The Moon Lord is the final boss of Terraria, and drops a majority of the endgame items, such as the Meowmere. It also drops Luminite, an ore used to craft many endgame armor sets and tools. It is summoned by defeating all four of the Celestial Pillars from the Lunar Events, or by using a Celestial Sigil. It has a combined health of 145,000 / 217,500 / 277,311, the most health of any boss in the game.
                    Moon Lord has two hands and a head which must be killed by attacking the eyes on them, and when killed will release invincible True Eyes of Cthulhu. When the three eyes are destroyed, the Moon Lord's core opens up on his chest, which must then be destroyed to defeat the boss.
                    Moon Lord's hands shoot two projectiles at once which home onto the player, and summon phantom versions of the True Eye of Cthulhu and throwing them at the player. Moon Lord's top eye will occasionally fire a Phantasmal Deathray that will sweep across the entire screen. Being very deadly to players, it can be avoided by hiding under solid blocks (it will pass through blocks on the Desktop version Desktop version), or by trying to escape its wrath on a flying mount. When the True Eyes of Cthulhu are released, the places where they used to be will inflict minor contact damage. The True Eyes of Cthulhu will fire less damaging versions of many of the same attacks as they did when they were still enclosed within the Moon Lord.
                    In Expert Mode, Moon Lord's Phantasmal Deathray attack deals a lot more damage, enough to kill most players in one hit.

            <section class="main-section" id="Events">
                <header>Events</header>
                <p>
                    Events (some also known as Invasions) are temporary occasions where varieties of special enemies spawn, most at elevated spawn rates, even near NPCs, and attack players. Some events can occur randomly during gameplay, while others can be triggered via certain summoning items or special circumstances. Events spawn their own unique enemies not seen during ordinary gameplay, which can, in turn, drop unique items that are only obtainable within the event. Some events also bring unique visuals and a unique atmosphere, such as an altered Moon and noticeable shaders applied to the screen. Events also are accompanied by their own special music, adding on to their theme. Depending on the particular event, they may last until a certain time limit is reached, or until a certain number of enemies are defeated. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the Desktop version Desktop version, Console version Console version, and Mobile version Mobile version, a progress bar can be seen in the bottom right corner of the screen (bottom-center on Mobile version Mobile) to indicate how far the player has gone into the event, and how far they are from completing it. It only appears during invasion-style events (Goblin Army, Slime RainDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions (only if 75/150 slimes are defeated), Old One's ArmyDesktop and Console versions, Frost Legion, Pirate Invasion, Pumpkin Moon, Frost Moon, and Martian MadnessDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions) and will not appear during events that are time-limited (Blood Moon, Rain, Slime RainDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions (only if less than 75/150 slimes are killed), Sandstorm, and Solar Eclipse). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that certain invasions (Goblin Army, Frost Legion, Pirate Invasion, and Martian MadnessDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions) have location requirements. The player must be no deeper than 67.5 tiles below the surface, and the player must be within 187.5 tiles horizontally of the location of the invasion. If the invasion has reached the center of the world, then the horizontal check can also be satisfied by the player being within 187.5 tiles horizontally of any town NPC, although at a reduced spawn rate. The town NPC's vertical position is not checked and so they can be housed far above or below your arena.

            <section class="main-section" id="Tools">
                <header>Tools</header>
                <p>
                    Tools are an association of items that are used to perform the various non-combat tasks involved in Terraria gameplay, such as construction and exploration, among others. Tools are generally wielded via the ⚒ Use / Attack key while they are held as the active hotbar item; though they are differentiated from weapons, whose primary use is instead to inflict damage upon enemies. Tools are also differentiated from accessories, which provide passive abilities, while tools are used proactively. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pickaxes, axes, and hammers are tools that are essential at all stages of gameplay for their ability to precisely dismantle world tiles, like placed blocks, background walls, plants, or placed furniture, and convert them all to collectible inventory items for re-placement in other locations, or for other uses, such as crafting. They also double as weak melee weapons and generally inflict far less damage than actual weapons of corresponding tiers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other important tools include: the Magic Mirror, which will teleport the player back to their spawn point; hooks, which aid travel above and below ground; the Bucket, which transports liquid; the Bug Net, used to catch critters; and the Wrenches, used for constructing mechanisms. Many of these tools are generally used throughout all stages of the game. 
                </p>
                <h3>Multi-use tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Some tools have combined functionality: 
                    <ul>
                        <il>Hammer + axe: hamaxes</il>
                        <il>Pickaxe/drill + axe: Pickaxe Axe, Drax, Shroomite Digging Claw, and Picksaw</il>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Pickaxes and drills</h3>
                <p>
                    Pickaxes and drills are used to free placed blocks or furniture for collection. When used on blocks, this is often referred to as "mining" or "digging". Their tier determines which types of blocks they can mine, as well as the number of hits it takes to remove each block type. Drills function identically to pickaxes, but with an alternate animation and sound effect. All tools to the right and below (and including itself) of the Cobalt Drill are Hardmode (3DS version with one exception; the Drax can be obtained pre-Hardmode). The player begins with the Copper Pickaxe when starting a new Classic character, and an Iron Pickaxe when starting a new JourneyDesktop version character. 
                </p>
                <h3>Axes and chainsaws</h3>
                <p>
                    Axes and chainsaws are used to harvest background plants like trees, cacti, and Giant Glowing Mushrooms (Wood blocks are removed with a pickaxe/drill instead). Chainsaws function identically to axes, but with an alternate animation and sound effect. Hamaxes function as both axes and hammers. The player begins with the Copper Axe when starting a new Classic character, and an Iron Axe when starting a new Journey version character. 
                </p>
                <strong>Hammers</strong>
                <p>
                    Hammers are used to free background walls for collection, to destroy background walls which cannot be collected, to shape foreground blocks to create slopes and half-tiles, and to shape platforms. They are also used to destroy Shadow Orbs and Crimson Hearts. The Pwnhammer, Hammush, and The Axe can additionally be used in Hardmode to destroy Altars, which triggers the spawning of new Hardmode ores.
                </p>
                <h3>Hooks</h3>
                <p>
                    Hooks are used to surmount tall obstacles and negotiate gaps, by latching and hoisting the player onto remote surfaces. 
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Weapons">
                <header>Weapons</header>
                <p>
                    Weapons are essential items used for combat against enemies, bosses, critters, and even other players during PvP games. Some weapons can be crafted at a Work Bench or a Pre-Hardmode/Hardmode Anvil, while others can only be found in Chests, as enemy drops, or purchased from NPCs. Terraria has a wide variety of weapons and weapon classes, each suited to particular play styles or specific tasks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most tools can also be used as weapons, despite it not being their primary purpose. In the broader sense, traps, self-defending NPCs Desktop, Console, and Mobile versions, and even lava can be used as a weapon.
                </p>
                <h3>Melee Weapons</h3>
                <strong>Swords</strong>
                <p>
                    Swords are melee weapons which can be divided into 2 basic categories: shortswords and broadswords. Shortswords have very limited range, and they attack with a horizontal stabbing motion instead of an arc. On Desktop version Desktop, they act more similarly to spears, being able to stab in more directions. Broadswords are swung overhead, which makes it easier to defeat flying and jumping enemies. 
                </p>
                <strong>Yoyos</strong>
                <p>
                    YoyosDesktop, Console, and Mobile versions are flail-like melee weapons that follow the player's cursor when thrown. 
                </p>
                <strong>Spears</strong>
                <p>
                    Spears are melee weapons that have a longer range than most swords, but attack with a stabbing motion. Spears also can hit targets more than once, making them especially useful for dealing with large enemies. 
                </p>
                <strong>Boomerangs</strong>
                <p>
                    Boomerangs are melee weapons that return to the player after being thrown. Together with yoyos, they provide the earliest distance attacks that benefit from melee bonuses.
                </p>
                <strong>Flails</strong>
                <p>
                    Flails are melee weapons that consist of an object linked to the player by a chain, which can either be thrown or fired. Thrown flails can be suspended around the player indefinitely, whereas launched flails immediately return to the player. 
                </p>
                <h3>Ranged Weapons</h3>
                <strong>Bows</strong>
                <p>
                    Bows are ranged weapons that fire arrows as ammunition. Although several bows deal no knockback, most arrows do. 
                </p>
                <strong>Repeaters</strong>
                <p>
                    Repeaters are ranged weapons that fire arrows as ammunition, similar to bows. All repeaters are Hardmode-exclusive. 
                </p>
                <strong>Guns</strong>
                <p>
                    Guns are a type of ranged weapon that use bullets as ammo. 
                </p>
                <strong>Launchers</strong>
                <p>
                    Launchers are Hardmode-exclusive ranged weapons that fire rockets and similar explosive ammunition.  
                </p>
                <h3>Magic Weapons</h3>
                <strong>Wands</strong>
                <p>
                    Wands are magic weapons that are mainly used to deal damage via a projectile attack. 
                </p>
                <h3>Summoning weapons</h3>
                <strong>Minion-summoning weapons</strong>
                <p>
                    These weapons summon minions to attack enemies.  
                </p>
                <strong>Sentry-summoning weapons</strong>
                <p>
                    These weapons summon Sentries to attack enemies, though sentries don't move like Minions.   
                </p>
